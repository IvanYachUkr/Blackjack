Welcome to the Game of 21!

RULES:
The goal of the game is to achieve a hand value of 21 or as close to it as possible without going over. If your hand value exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the round. The dealer must draw cards until their hand is at least 17. If the dealer busts or your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over, you win. If both hands are equal, it's a draw.

COMMANDS:

    hit - Draw another card from the deck. Use this when you believe another card will bring you closer to 21 without busting.
    Example: hit / h

    stand - End your turn and stick with your current hand value. This signals that you do not want any more cards, and the dealer will then take their turn.
    Example: stand / s

    round - Starts a new round manually. This clears both the player's and the dealer's hands and deals new cards to both.
    Example: round / r

    stat - Shows the statistics of your game session, including the number of rounds played, won, lost, and draws.
    Example: stat

    help - Provides a list of available commands and general game assistance.
    Example: help

    quit - Exits the game session.
    Example: quit

ENDING A ROUND:

    The round ends when either the player or dealer busts, or if the player stands. The game will then evaluate the hands and declare a winner or a draw.
    If the player busts, the dealer wins. If the dealer busts or the player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, the player wins.
    If the player stands, the dealer will draw cards until their hand's value is 17 or higher.

Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
